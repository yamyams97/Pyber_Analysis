# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of module 5 was to help V. Isualize create a summary of a DataFrame with the ride-sharing company Py-Ber. We were tasked with creating a DataFrame summary of the number of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per rider, and the average fare per driver based on the type of cities. With the data provided, we had to calculate all of this by using the 'groupby' function, as well as the 'count' and 'sum' functions of pandas. After we were done fomatting our DataFrame, we were then tasked with creating a multiple line chart that shows the total cost of fares per city type between Jan. 1, 2019- April 29, 2019. 
### Results 
Based on our DataFrame, we see that Urban cities had an overwhelmingly larger amount of total rides, with Rural cities being the lowest of the three. There is an inverse relationship with total rides and cost per ride and per driver. This seems to follow the economic trend of as supply and demand both increase, the cost goes down. Since more people are willing to use the ride-share service, the price has to be more affordable in order for people to want to use them. As we move into rural areas, since there are less people using it, as well as less drivers, the cost per trip will go up. We could also take into consideration the fact that urban markets are much closer in proximity, so the length of the rides are not as long as in rural areas. 

### Grpah Results
Switching over to our graph, we don't seem to have anything out of the ordinary happening. There is no real increase, or decrease happening between the months of January and April. The slope of our lines are close to 0, which means our correlation coefficient is also close to 0.
